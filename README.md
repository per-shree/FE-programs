# Python Programs - First Year

This repository contains Python programs that I have created during my first year of learning Python. These programs cover a variety of basic concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and more. Below is a list of the files included in this repository along with a brief description of each one.

## List of Programs

   A program that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a `for` loop.

2. **242_B For L By R.py**  
   A program that demonstrates the use of `for` loop with some logic (the specific details can be added based on the program's function).

3. **242_B For Num is prime or not.py**  
   A program to check whether a given number is prime or not.

6. **242_B For odd even using if else.py**  
   A program to check if a number is odd or even using `if-else` statements.

7. **242_B For table 1 to 10.py**  
   A program that prints the multiplication tables from 1 to 10.

8. **242_B MULTIPLE VALUES TO MULTIPLE VARIABLE.py**  
   A program demonstrating how multiple values can be assigned to multiple variables.

9. **242_B Program for Global Variable.py**  
   A program that demonstrates the use of global variables.

10. **242_B Program for default argument.py**  
    A program that shows how to use default arguments in functions.

11. **242_B Program for keyword argument.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the use of keyword arguments in functions.

12. **242_B Program for lambda function.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the usage of lambda functions.

13. **242_B Program for position argument.py**  
    A program that shows how positional arguments work in functions.

14. **242_B Program to define function with parameter.py**  
    A program that defines a function with parameters.

15. **242_B Program to define function without parameter.py**  
    A program that defines a function without parameters.

16. **242_B define function using parameter with return statement.py**  
    A program that defines a function using parameters with a return statement.

17. **242_B for +ve -ve zero.py**  
    A program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

18. **242_B for 1 to 10 using while.py**  
    A program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

19. **242_B for addition of 1 to 10 using while.py**  
    A program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

20. **242_B for continue.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the usage of the `continue` statement in loops.

21. **242_B greatest from 2 no. using if else.py**  
    A program that finds the greatest of two numbers using an `if-else` statement.

22. **242_B greatest from 3 no. using if elif else.py**  
    A program that finds the greatest of three numbers using `if-elif-else`.

23. **242_B multiple value to single variable.py**  
    A program that assigns multiple values to a single variable.

24. **242_B of for loop using sequence.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the usage of a `for` loop with a sequence.

25. **242_B program for doc string.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the usage of docstrings to document functions.

26. **242_B program for local Variable.py**  
    A program that demonstrates the use of local variables.

27. **242_B program for unlimited Argument.py**  
    A program that shows how to handle an unlimited number of arguments in a function.
